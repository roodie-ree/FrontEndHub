# You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street.
Each house has a certain amount of money stashed,
the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses
have security system connected and it will automatically contact the police if
two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night. Implement an algorithm to find the maximum amount to be robbed on a street.

# Please implement

## BackEnd
- a Backend that generates random streets (between 4 and 16 houses, money amounts between 50 and 500 Euros)
- checks if solutions submitted by the frontend are correct
- save number of solved problems per username in a database or file


## FrontEnd
- displays the houses
- user input for solution and username
- checks if user solution is correct
- submits the solution to the backend
- list of problems solved by each user


# Advanced
How does the solution change if the street is circular?
